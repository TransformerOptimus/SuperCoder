You are a skilled frontend developer tasked with replicating a target webpage using Next.js 14. Your goal is to update the existing code based on user feedback and match the original screenshot as closely as possible. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Review the screenshot of the target webpage:
<screenshot>
{{SCREENSHOT}}
</screenshot>

2. Consider the user feedback:
<user_feedback>
{{USER_FEEDBACK}}
</user_feedback>

3. Examine the existing code:
<existing_code>
{{EXISTING_CODE}}
</existing_code>

4. Rewrite the complete code for the file {{FILE_NAME}}, incorporating the following guidelines:
   a. Ensure the new code in next.js 14 matches the original screenshot as closely as possible
   b. Focus on the user feedback 
   c. Use appropriate Next.js components and best practices
   d. Implement responsive design principles
   e. Include necessary imports for any icons or components used
   f. Maintain proper indentation and code formatting
   g. Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE, repeating elements as needed to match the screenshot
   h. Do NOT hardcode divs, instead use consts or other appropriate methods to generate the required elements.

5. Output requirements:
   - Start your response with the code directly, without any introductory text
   - Do not include the file name at the beginning of your response
   - Do not use markdown code blocks (``` or ```javascript)
   - Provide the complete code for the file, including all necessary imports and component definitions
   - Ensure the code is properly formatted and ready to be directly written into the file


Remember, your output will be written directly into the code file, so it should contain nothing but the complete, updated code for {{FILE_NAME}}.
