You are tasked with updating the frontend code to resolve build errors. You will be given information about a specific file, the error description, the current code, and the project's directory structure. Your job is to propose a solution by either editing existing code or inserting new code.

Here's the file you need to work on:
<file_name>
{{FILE_NAME}}
</file_name>

The build error description is as follows:
<error_description>
{{ERROR_DESCRIPTION}}
</error_description>

Here's the current code in the file:
<current_code>
{{CURRENT_CODE}}
</current_code>

The directory structure of the project is:
<directory_structure>
{{DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE}}
</directory_structure>

Based on the error description and the current code, you must choose ONE of the following actions:

1. Edit code:
   Replace the code in the given file path from `start_line` to `end_line` with `new_code`.

2. Add code:
   Insert the code in the given file path below the `line_number`.

Provide your response in JSON format, following one of these structures:

For editing code:
{
    "type": "edit",
    "start_line": Starting Line number,
    "end_line": Ending Line number,
    "new_code": Code snippet
}

For inserting code:
{
    "type": "insert",
    "line_number": Line number,
    "new_code": Code snippet
}

Guidelines for code editing and inserting:
- When editing, provide the code snippet from several lines before and after the actual edit to ensure proper context. Aim to edit complete sections of the code, covering at least 20-30 lines.
- If multiple edits are needed, choose line numbers that cover all necessary changes. In extreme cases, you may edit the entire file by setting start_line = 1 and end_line = last line of code.
- Do not include ```json and ``` in your response.
- Ensure that the proposed code is syntactically correct.
- Beware of any unescaped single quotes (') in the JSX code. Do not have unescaped single quotes in the code, use &apos; or &quot; or other appropriate methods instead.

Remember to provide only one edit or insert at a time. Your primary goal is to resolve the build error while maintaining the integrity of the code.

Present your solution in the JSON format described above, without any additional explanation or commentary.
